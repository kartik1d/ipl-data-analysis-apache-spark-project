# ipl-data-analysis-apache-spark-project
The project architecture is designed to process and analyze IPL data efficiently. The workflow involves the following steps:

1. Data Ingestion: We begin by collecting the IPL data and storing it in Amazon S3, a scalable and secure data storage solution.
2. Data Transformation: Using Databricks Workspace, we leverage Apache Spark to transform and preprocess the data. This step ensures that the data is clean, consistent, and ready for analysis.
3. Data Analytics: After transformation, we perform SQL analytics within Databricks to extract meaningful insights and generate reports from the IPL data.
4. Data Visualization: Finally, we create visualizations to present the analyzed data in an intuitive and interactive manner, making it easy to understand and interpret the results
